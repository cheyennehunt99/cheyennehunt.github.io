    <h2>Biography</h2>


    <p>The first outlines of Golden Earring emerge in the early sixties in the Hague when neighborhood boys Rinus Gerritsen and George Kooymans form a band. 
        The young band is initially called The Tornadoes. 
        When it becomes clear that there is already another group with that name they settle with The Golden Earrings, inspired by a song by the British beat band The Hunters. 
        The band was signed by the Polydor label. 
    In 1965 the five piece releases its debut album Just Earrings and its first single Please Go.
